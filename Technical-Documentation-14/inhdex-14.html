          <p>
            Figma is a vector design tool that runs in the browser. Use Figma to brainstorm ideas,
            iterate on designs, create prototypes, and get feedback at any stage of the creative
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this beginners course, we're going to take you through key stages of designing an app
            in Figma, from the initial wireframes to an interactive prototype.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll cover the basics, and introduce more powerful features like Auto Layout,
            Components, and Prototyping. There's something for everyone, whether you're new to
            design or new to Figma.
          </p>
          <p>
            We won't cover all these features in depth, but we'll provide you with resources to
            continue your Figma education

            We're pretty sure we have the next million dollar idea - a social media app... for pets!
            We want some feedback on the general layout, before we start exploring specific elements
            of our design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wireframes are simplified designs that are devoid of any style, like color, type, or
            imagery. They allow us to map out user flows and explore different ways we can structure
            our app, without having to design any elements, or add any content.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll start our journey by creating some wireframes in Figma design. Create a new file
            heading to figma.com/new in the browser.
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              <p class="title">Canvas</p>
              <p>
                The canvas is the backdrop for all of your designs - it's where you'll add all the
                frames, shapes, text, and images.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are no bounds to your creativity, but you should know the canvas extends
                approximately 65,000 points in each direction.
              </p>
              <p>
                By default, the canvas color is set to <code>#E5E5E5</code>. To change the canvas
                color:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Click on an empty spot in the canvas to deselect any layers</li>
                <li>In the right sidebar, click the swatch in the <span>Page</span> section.</li>
                <li>Select a new color using the color picker.</li>
                <li>
                  Or, click <sub><code class="material-symbols-outlined">visibility</code></sub> to
                  toggle off the background entirely.
                </li>

                  <strong>Tip!</strong> We mentioned earlier that Figma is a vector design tool.
                  Unlike pixels, which have a fixed dimension, vector paths are
                  resolution-independent. This means you can easily scale them to suit your designs.
                  You can use pixel preview to see how your designs will look when you export them
                  as rasterized (pixel-based) assets.
                </p>

            <li>
              <p class="title">Frames</p>
              <p>
                With the great expanse that is the canvas, you need something to put your designs
                in. Enter frames. Frames are the containers you place your shape, text, and image
                layers in. You can think of each frame in the canvas as a single screen of your
                design.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you've used other design tools, you might be familiar with artboards. Frames are
                Figma's version of an artboard!
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The toolbar contains the tools you need for creating layers. Select the
                  <sub><code class="material-symbols-outlined">grid_3x3</code></sub> frame tool in
                  the toolbar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Frame presets, in the sidebar on the right, let us create frames with specific
                  dimensions. We know that we're making a mobile app, so we'll select
                  <span>Google Pixel 2 XL</span> from the presets.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Two exciting things just happened, Figma added a frame to our canvas, and the
                sidebar on the left is no longer empty. Everything that we add to the canvas will
                also be added to the layers panel. Let's right-click on this frame and rename it
                <code>home</code>
              </p>
              <div class="box blue">
                <p>
                  <strong>Move around the canvas: </strong>To explore more of the the canvas we can
                  use two fingers on a trackpad - or the scroll wheel on a mouse - to pan around. We
                  can also press and hold the space bar and click and drag to pan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you're using a trackpad you can use the pinch gestures to zoom in and out. You
                  can also use shortcuts like <code>⌘Command</code> - <code>+</code> and
                  <code>⌘Command</code> - <code>-</code> to zoom in our out. For granular control,
                  adjust the zoom level in your view settings.

            Now you're ready to add some layers to your frame! As this is a wireframe, you can use
            shapes, like rectangles and ellipses, to represent more complex aspects of the design.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Select the <sub><code class="material-symbols-outlined">square</code></sub>
                <span>rectangle tool</span> to create an image for a post on your app's home page.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Just like frames, every layer in the canvas has dimensions. You can adjust a layer's
                position and dimensions in a few ways.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              <p class="title">Position</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Click and hold on the layer you want to reposition. Drag the layer to the part
                    of the canvas you'd like to position it on. Release to apply.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    To set specific co-ordinates, you can update the <code>X</code> and
                    <code>Y</code> fields for that layer. These co-ordinates correspond to the
                    top-left corner of the layer.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="title">Dimensions</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Hover over the bounds of a layer until the cursor appears. Click and drag to
                    change the size of the layer.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    To set specific dimensions, you can update the layer's dimensions using the
                    width (<span>W</span>) and height (<span>H</span>) fields in the right sidebar.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p class="title">Parents and children</p>
              <p>
                If you look in the layers panel, you can see the rectangle is within the home frame.
                Some layers, like frames, can contain other layers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use the analogy of parents, children, and siblings to describe relationships
                between layers. You may know these terms if you're familiar with web development or
                programming.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <span>Parents</span> are layers that contain other layers. Think frames,
                    components, and groups.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <span>Children</span> are layers within a parent. Think of the text and shape
                    layers within a component or group.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <span>Siblings</span> are layers within the same parent. Layers need to be at
                    the same level in the layer hierarchy to be siblings.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you move the rectangle outside of the frame, the Layers panel will update to
                reflect the change in that relationship. We call this reparenting. Figma uses the
                dimensions of the relevant layers to determine whether to reparent.

                New shape layers have a gray fill by default, but we can apply another color or

                We want our wireframes to appear like outlines instead of solid shapes. We can do
                this using the stroke property. Strokes work like outlines or borders around our
                shapes and layers.

                Hold down <code>Shift</code> again to constrain the rectangle's proportions and

            Instead of drawing three separate squares, we can copy the original layer. There are a
            few ways to copy layers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Hold down the <code>⌥ Option</code> (MacOS) or <code>Alt</code> (Windows) key, click
                on the square layer, and drag to create a copy.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Press <code>⌘ Command-D</code> (Mac) or <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>D</code> (Windows)
                to duplicate the layer and create the third square.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Figma recognizes the distance between the first two squares and keeps the same
                distance.
              </p>

              <strong>Tip!</strong>If we want to change the uniform spacing between them, we can
